Some scripts that I created to train and use in cybersecurity tasks.

## Scripts Overview

### first_script

This script automates the creation of a directory structure for organizing cybersecurity-related files. It creates specific folders under a main directory and generates `.txt` files containing predefined content in each subdirectory. This structure is intended for organizing notes or logs related to different cybersecurity topics.

### second_script

This script gathers and displays essential system information, including OS details, CPU model, memory usage, disk space, and logged-in users. It also has an option to output the collected data into a file, making it useful for system audits and monitoring.

These scripts were developed during my first semester in university and represent the foundational tools I created while learning about cybersecurity and system administration.
