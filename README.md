# DevSecOps

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I created to train and use in cybersecurity tasks.

## Scripts Overview

### `setup_cybersecurity_notes.sh`

This script automates the creation of a directory structure to organize cybersecurity-related files. It creates specific folders under a main directory and generates `.txt` files containing predefined content in each subdirectory. This structure is intended for organizing notes or logs related to different cybersecurity topics.

### `system_info_report.sh`

This script gathers and displays essential system information, including OS details, CPU model, memory usage, disk space, and logged-in users. It also has an option to save the collected data into a file, making it useful for system audits and monitoring.

### `subdomains.py`

This script performs GET requests on a list of subdomains, attempting to resolve DNS and returning the HTTP status code for each subdomain. It is a simple and effective tool for testing the presence of active subdomains on a specific domain.

### `read_top_passwords.py`

This script reads and displays the first 10 lines of a file named `darkweb2017-top100.txt`, which contains a list of the most common passwords collected from the dark web in 2017. It is useful for quick analysis of password lists or for brute-force testing in controlled environments.

## About

These scripts were developed during my first semester at university and represent the foundational tools I created while learning about cybersecurity and system administration.
